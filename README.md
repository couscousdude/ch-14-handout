## How to compile locally

This will repository is configured to automatically compile and release a PDF to its releases page on any push to the main branch. However, if you
want to compile and edit it locally (eg. to test out LaTeX formatting), you should compile it using `latexmk`, by entering the project's root directory
and running `latexmk`. We recommend you install the TeXLive LaTeX distribution, to ensure you have all the necessary packages and CLI tools to build the
document properly.
