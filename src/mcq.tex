          \item Transactions demand and supply demand
          \item Asset demand and liability demand
          \item Transactions demand and asset demand

  \item Assume the following:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The economy's MPC is 0.8
          \item The Fed increases the money supply by \$500 million
